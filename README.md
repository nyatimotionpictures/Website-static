# Distribution Folder

This folder contains the production-ready build of the Nyati Motion Pictures marketing website. It is generated by the build process using **Vite** and is optimized for deployment.

## Overview

The `dist` folder includes all the necessary files to serve the application in a production environment. It contains minified and optimized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and asset files.

## Contents

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the application.
- **assets/**: Contains all the static assets, including images, fonts, and other media files used in the application.
- **js/**: Minified JavaScript files necessary for the functionality of the website.
- **css/**: Minified CSS files that style the application.

## Deployment

To deploy the website, you can follow these steps:

1. Copy the contents of the `dist` folder to your web server or hosting provider.
2. Ensure that your server is configured to serve the `index.html` file for all routes (if using client-side routing).
3. Access your website through your domain or public IP address.

### Example Deployment Commands

For deploying using a simple HTTP server like `serve`, you can run:

```bash
npm install -g serve
serve -s dist
```

This command will serve the content of the `dist` folder on your local machine. 

## Building the Project

If you need to create or update the contents of the `dist` folder, you can build the project by running:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This command will compile the source code and output the production build into the `dist` folder.

## Notes

- Ensure that any changes made to the source code are followed by a new build process to reflect the changes in the `dist` folder.
- Keep the `dist` folder up-to-date to ensure that the deployed version of the website is always the latest.
